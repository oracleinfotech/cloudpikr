                                    <h2>Introduction</h2>

                                    <p>For a customer, what’s a win-win situation? You have to pay ONLY if you get the desired results. Is that possible in a digital marketing business?Yes, it is… through Performance Marketing.As the name clearly suggests, its marketing based on performance. </p>

                                    <p>The non-profit Performance Marketing Association defines it as “a comprehensive term that refers to online marketing and advertising programs in which advertisers (a.k.a., “retailers” or “merchants”) pay marketing companies (a.k.a., “affiliates” or “publishers”) when a specific action is completed; such as a sale, lead or click.”</p>

                                    <p>Different are the expectations for different types of businesses and their requirements. For an advertising company/platform, the number of clicks matters the most, while for some it’s the cost per sale.</p>

                                    <p>Each step in the sales funnel can be aligned to a metric in performance marketing. For example, if you want to create awareness, you focus on cost per impression; while to trigger some traffic, you optimize on cost per click. Similarly, to generate some consideration towards buying a product/service, the measure is cost per lead; whereas cost per sale is the ultimate motive.</p>

                                    <p>Being result driven, performance marketing is a good tool to drive actions, track and measure those actions; along with measuring the ROI of each asset, campaign or activity.

                                        Hence, Performance Marketing is a marketing campaign where businesses/customers pay only when they achieve the expected results. These can be in the form of leads, clicks, impressions, engagements, conversions or sales.</p>

                                    <h3>Why Performance Marketing?</h3>

                                    <p>In the digital world, everything is available online and we see a number of advertisements and promotions from several companies every moment. More and more marketers are inclining towards performance marketing to focus on the results of their efforts.

                                        You can measure everything be it the reach of your brand, the conversion or even the outcomes of a single advertisement through performance marketing. One of the key elements is Return on Investment (ROI), which is very much quantifiable and is the main measuring metric for performance marketing. </p>

                                    <p>Accomplishing the specific goal and paying only after it is successfully achieved is what gives an edge to performance marketing as compared to other marketing efforts. This cost-effective approach gives the marketers the advantage of focussing more on attaining marketing and sales goals, as compared to paying large sums of upfront fees for just brand awareness.</p>

                                    <h3>Performance Marketing – its Measurable</h3>

                                    <p><b>CPV (Cost per View):</b>CPV is generally used for video ads, as marketers only pay when the video is actually watched. However, what constitutes a “view” varies by platform and campaign, so it’s important to know what you want to gain from these ads and that you give consumers the relevant information upfront.</p>

                                    <p><b>CPM (Cost per Mile/Thousand):</b> This denotes the structure where advertisers pay after a certain number of views, typically per thousand. This is generally used for website ads or ads where interactivity is not required to get the desired outcome.</p>

                                    <p><b>CPC (Cost per Click):</b> It signifies the fee paid, every time the ad is clicked. CPC is a better indicator of engagement than CPM, as the action is already taken by clicking the ad. Hence, the chances of conversions are higher. </p>
                                    <p><b>CPA (Cost Per Action):</b> CPA measures the performance when the desired actions are taken by the target audience. These actions can be in the form of downloads, subscriptions, purchase or any other practice. It is one of the important metrics as the desired outcome is achieved here.</p>
                                    <p><b>LTV (Lifetime Value):</b> LTV denotes the predicted “Lifetime Value” of an individual customer during their association with the brand or company. LTV estimates the expected spend of acquired customers based on their ongoing activity, using advanced methods like predictive analytics. LTV can help marketers plan their overall strategies towards the ultimate goal of boosting ROI.</p>
                                    <p><b>Cost Per Sale (CPS):</b> This model is based on actual sales. You pay to the marketer only when an actual sale (involving an actual credit card transaction) has been completed.</p>


                                    <h3>Channels of Performance Marketing</h3>

                                    <p>Display Advertising: Banner ads, rich media, etc. are a common form of display ads that are frequently used for awareness campaigns.

                                    <p>Native Advertising: Mostly used for re-targeting, native advertising provides the target customers with useful and valuable information to attract their attention and drive them to perform a specific action. In fact, it doesn’t look like an advertisement as native ads appear as relevant content while the customer is reading on a particular topic. The common metric used for native ads are pay per impression or pay per click.</p>
                                    

                                    <p>Social Media Marketing: Social media is a vast world providing a number of platforms to connect with your audience, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc. Performance Marketing campaigns on such platforms usually involve either influencer marketing or paid advertising strategies. The performance metrics commonly monitored for social media marketing are likes, shares, comments, clicks, sales, and checkouts.</p>

                                    <p>Sponsored Content: This involves working with influencers, prominent figures, and content curation sites. They promote a particular brand, product or service in the post, article or video, in exchange of a fee. The payment can be in the form of free products, services, experiences, or even monetary. The common performance metrics are cost-per-click (CPC), cost-per-mile (CPM), or cost-per-action (CPA). 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Affiliate Marketing: Some believe affiliate marketing and performance marketing are two sides of the same coin. However, in reality, affiliate marketing is a part of performance marketing. Banner ads on websites, partnerships with affiliates/publishers in the form of product reviewers, coupon websites, online magazines, blogs, etc. </p>
